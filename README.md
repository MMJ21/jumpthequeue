# jumpthequeue
This project is being used as a test project for my introduction to DevOps tools and methods during my internship at Capgemini. 

Jump The Queue is a mock project used to introduce learners into the devon4j and devon4ng architectures. I developed it locally following the guide at https://github.com/devonfw/jump-the-queue/wiki before uploading it to this repository.

In this repo, I've added to the base project:
- Dockerfiles needed in order to containerize the application.
- Configurations for enabling a Jenkins CI/CD enviroment.
- YAMLs for workflows using GitHub Actions.
